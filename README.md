# Secret-Santa
Generate your secret santa pairings. Just enter the names of the participants and it will do the rest 

This is a MATLAB code that chouses the secret santa pairs randomly. First, someone should enter the names of all participants. Then, leave the algorithm do its thing. Finally, each participant should enter his name individually to see who is his secret santa.  Have fun ;)
